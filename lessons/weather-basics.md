# Weather Fundamentals

## Overview
Weather knowledge is critical for aviation safety. This lesson covers the basic weather theory and phenomena that affect flight operations.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand atmospheric composition and structure
- Explain how weather systems form and move
- Identify hazardous weather conditions
- Interpret weather reports and forecasts
- Make informed go/no-go decisions based on weather

## The Atmosphere

### Composition
The atmosphere consists of:
- **Nitrogen**: 78%
- **Oxygen**: 21%
- **Other gases**: 1% (argon, CO2, water vapor, etc.)

### Layers of the Atmosphere
1. **Troposphere** (0-36,000 ft average)
   - Where weather occurs
   - Temperature decreases with altitude
   - Contains most water vapor

2. **Stratosphere** (36,000-160,000 ft)
   - Stable air
   - Ozone layer
   - Little weather activity

## Temperature and Heat Transfer

### Heat Transfer Methods
- **Conduction**: Direct contact heat transfer
- **Convection**: Heat transfer through fluid motion
- **Radiation**: Heat transfer through electromagnetic waves

### Effects on Aviation
- Temperature inversions affect visibility
- Thermal convection creates turbulence
- Differential heating drives wind patterns

## Atmospheric Pressure

### Key Concepts
- Standard sea level pressure: 29.92" Hg or 1013.25 mb
- Pressure decreases with altitude
- Pressure systems drive weather patterns

### High vs. Low Pressure
**High Pressure Systems**:
- Descending air
- Generally good weather
- Clockwise circulation (Northern Hemisphere)

**Low Pressure Systems**:
- Rising air
- Usually poor weather
- Counterclockwise circulation (Northern Hemisphere)

## Wind

### Wind Formation
Wind is air moving from high pressure to low pressure areas, deflected by the Coriolis effect.

### Types of Wind
- **Surface winds**: Affected by friction
- **Gradient winds**: Blow parallel to isobars aloft
- **Sea breeze**: Daytime flow from water to land
- **Land breeze**: Nighttime flow from land to water

### Wind Shear
A sudden change in wind speed or direction. Particularly hazardous:
- During takeoff and landing
- Near thunderstorms
- With frontal passage
- In temperature inversions

## Moisture and Clouds

### Humidity
- **Relative humidity**: Ratio of actual to maximum water vapor
- **Dew point**: Temperature at which air becomes saturated
- **Spread**: Difference between temperature and dew point

### Cloud Formation
Clouds form when:
1. Air becomes saturated
2. Temperature reaches dew point
3. Condensation nuclei present

### Cloud Types

**By Altitude**:
- **Low** (surface-6,500 ft): Stratus, cumulus
- **Middle** (6,500-20,000 ft): Altostratus, altocumulus
- **High** (20,000-40,000 ft): Cirrus, cirrostratus

**By Development**:
- **Stratiform**: Layered, stable air
- **Cumuliform**: Puffy, unstable air
- **Cirriform**: Wispy, ice crystals

## Precipitation

### Types
- **Rain**: Liquid water drops
- **Drizzle**: Small drops, light intensity
- **Snow**: Ice crystals
- **Sleet**: Frozen rain
- **Freezing rain**: Supercooled rain (very hazardous!)
- **Hail**: Ice pellets from thunderstorms

## Air Masses and Fronts

### Air Mass Types
- **Continental**: Formed over land (dry)
- **Maritime**: Formed over water (moist)
- **Polar**: Cold source region
- **Tropical**: Warm source region

### Fronts
**Cold Front**:
- Cold air replaces warm air
- Steep frontal surface
- Fast-moving
- Can produce severe weather

**Warm Front**:
- Warm air replaces cold air
- Gradual frontal slope
- Slower-moving
- Extended areas of clouds and precipitation

**Stationary Front**:
- Little movement
- Extended period of clouds and weather

**Occluded Front**:
- Cold front overtakes warm front
- Complex weather patterns

## Hazardous Weather

### Thunderstorms
**Three stages**:
1. Cumulus (building)
2. Mature (precipitation begins)
3. Dissipating

**Hazards**:
- Severe turbulence
- Lightning
- Hail
- Tornadoes
- Microbursts
- Severe icing

> **Rule**: Never fly through a thunderstorm! Avoid by at least 20 miles.

### Icing
**Types**:
- **Rime ice**: Rough, milky appearance
- **Clear ice**: Smooth, glossy, heavy
- **Mixed ice**: Combination of both

**Conditions for Icing**:
- Visible moisture
- Temperature near or below freezing
- Flight through clouds or precipitation

### Fog
**Types**:
- **Radiation fog**: Clear nights, light winds
- **Advection fog**: Warm, moist air over cold surface
- **Upslope fog**: Moist air forced up terrain
- **Steam fog**: Cold air over warm water

## Weather Information

### METARs (Aviation Routine Weather Report)
```
KBOS 121754Z 09014KT 10SM FEW250 23/14 A2990
```
- KBOS: Station identifier
- 121754Z: Date/time (12th day, 1754 UTC)
- 09014KT: Wind from 090° at 14 knots
- 10SM: Visibility 10 statute miles
- FEW250: Few clouds at 25,000 ft
- 23/14: Temperature 23°C, dew point 14°C
- A2990: Altimeter 29.90" Hg

### TAFs (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast)
Airport forecasts valid for 24-30 hours.

### Weather Briefings
- **Standard Briefing**: Complete weather picture
- **Abbreviated Briefing**: Update or supplement
- **Outlook Briefing**: Advance planning (>6 hours)

## Making Weather Decisions

### Go/No-Go Decision Factors
- Current and forecast weather
- Personal minimums vs. legal minimums
- Aircraft capabilities and equipment
- Pilot experience and currency
- Alternate plans available

### Personal Minimums
Establish limits stricter than regulations:
- Higher ceiling and visibility requirements
- Lower maximum wind speeds
- Better weather for night flight
- Conservative icing and thunderstorm avoidance

## Practical Exercise

### Weather Briefing Analysis
1. Obtain a standard weather briefing
2. Identify:
   - Current conditions along route
   - Expected weather trends
   - Hazardous weather (AIRMETs/SIGMETs)
   - Suitable alternates
3. Make a go/no-go decision
4. Justify your decision with specific weather factors

## Summary
Weather is dynamic and constantly changing. Pilots must:
- Continuously monitor weather
- Understand weather theory
- Interpret weather information correctly
- Make conservative decisions
- Always have an alternate plan

**Remember**: "It's better to be on the ground wishing you were in the air, than in the air wishing you were on the ground."
