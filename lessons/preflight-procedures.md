# Preflight Procedures

## Overview
Thorough preflight procedures are the first line of defense against mechanical failures and ensure the aircraft is airworthy before flight. This lesson covers systematic preflight inspection and preparation.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the importance of preflight procedures
- Perform a systematic aircraft inspection
- Identify common discrepancies
- Complete required preflight documentation
- Ensure aircraft is airworthy and properly configured

## Regulatory Requirements

### FAR 91.103 - Preflight Action
Pilots must become familiar with all available information concerning the flight, including:
- Weather reports and forecasts
- Fuel requirements
- Alternatives if flight cannot be completed
- Known traffic delays (IFR)
- Runway lengths and takeoff/landing distances

### FAR 91.7 - Airworthiness
The pilot in command is responsible for determining that the aircraft is in condition for safe flight.

## Preflight Inspection Sequence

### 1. Documentation Review

**Required Documents (ARROW)**:
- [ ] **A**irworthiness Certificate
- [ ] **R**egistration Certificate
- [ ] **R**adio Station License (if required)
- [ ] **O**perating Handbook (POH/AFM)
- [ ] **W**eight and Balance Data

**Maintenance Logs**:
- [ ] Annual inspection current (within 12 calendar months)
- [ ] 100-hour inspection (if required)
- [ ] VOR check (within 30 days for IFR)
- [ ] Altimeter/static system (within 24 calendar months for IFR)
- [ ] Transponder (within 24 calendar months)
- [ ] ELT battery (50% life or 1 hour cumulative use)

### 2. Cockpit Preparation

**Before Leaving the Cockpit**:
- [ ] Check ignition switch OFF
- [ ] Check master switch OFF
- [ ] Control lock removed
- [ ] Required equipment present
- [ ] Weight and balance calculated
- [ ] Performance charts reviewed
- [ ] Fuel quantity noted

### 3. External Inspection

**Systematic Approach**:
Start at the pilot's door and proceed clockwise (or follow POH checklist)

#### Fuselage and Empennage
- [ ] Overall condition - no damage or corrosion
- [ ] Control surfaces secure and move freely
- [ ] Hinges and attach points secure
- [ ] Antennas secure
- [ ] Tail tie-down removed

#### Wings
- [ ] Leading edge condition
- [ ] Fuel caps secure and vented
- [ ] Fuel quantity verified (visual check)
- [ ] Fuel sumps drained for contamination
- [ ] Ailerons and flaps - secure, full travel
- [ ] Wing tie-downs removed
- [ ] Stall warning system checked

#### Landing Gear
- [ ] Tires - proper inflation, no damage
- [ ] Brakes - fluid level, no leaks
- [ ] Struts - proper inflation
- [ ] Wheel fairings secure
- [ ] Chocks removed before engine start

#### Engine Compartment
- [ ] Oil level - minimum required for flight
- [ ] Oil cap secure
- [ ] Fuel strainer drained
- [ ] General condition - no leaks or damage
- [ ] Air filter clean
- [ ] Cowling secure
- [ ] Propeller - no nicks, proper condition

#### Propeller and Spinner
- [ ] Propeller blades - no nicks or damage
- [ ] Spinner secure and undamaged
- [ ] Propeller moves freely (if applicable)

## Fuel Quality Check

### Fuel Sampling Procedure
1. Drain fuel from all sumps (wings, fuselage, engine)
2. Use clean, clear fuel sampler
3. Check for:
   - **Water**: Will separate and sink to bottom (looks like bubbles)
   - **Sediment**: Particles or debris
   - **Proper fuel grade**: Correct color
     - 100LL: Blue
     - Jet A: Clear/straw colored

> **Critical**: Even small amounts of water in fuel can cause engine failure. When in doubt, drain more.

## Weight and Balance

### Calculation Steps
1. Determine basic empty weight (from logs)
2. Add pilot and passengers
3. Add fuel weight (6 lbs/gallon)
4. Add baggage
5. Verify total weight within limits
6. Calculate CG position
7. Ensure CG within envelope

### Weight Limits
- Maximum ramp weight (includes start/taxi fuel)
- Maximum takeoff weight
- Maximum landing weight
- Maximum zero fuel weight (if applicable)

## Interior Preparation

### Cockpit Setup
- [ ] Seats adjusted and locked
- [ ] Seat belts and shoulder harnesses secured
- [ ] Required equipment accessible
- [ ] Loose items secured
- [ ] Circuit breakers checked IN
- [ ] Avionics master OFF
- [ ] Parking brake SET

### Passenger Briefing (SAFETY)
- [ ] **S**eatbelts - use and adjustment
- [ ] **A**ir vents and heat
- [ ] **F**ire extinguisher location
- [ ] **E**xit doors and windows - operation
- [ ] **T**raffic and talking - sterile cockpit concept
- [ ] **Y**our questions?

## Common Discrepancies

### Grounding Issues (No-Go Items)
- Low oil level
- Visible fuel contamination
- Structural damage
- Missing required equipment
- Expired inspections
- Open write-ups in logbook
- Flat tires
- Control restrictions

### Items Requiring Maintenance
- Minor oil leaks
- Worn tires
- Chipped paint
- Loose fasteners
- Navigation light issues
- Non-essential equipment inoperative

## Emergency Equipment

**Required Equipment** (depending on operation):
- [ ] Fire extinguisher
- [ ] First aid kit
- [ ] Survival kit (if appropriate)
- [ ] ELT functional
- [ ] Life vests (over water operations)

## Preflight Planning Integration

### Before Arriving at Airport
1. Weather briefing obtained
2. Flight plan prepared
3. NOTAMs reviewed
4. Performance calculations completed
5. Alternatives identified

### At the Airport
1. Aircraft availability confirmed
2. Documentation reviewed
3. Exterior inspection completed
4. Interior prepared
5. Weight and balance verified
6. Passengers briefed

## Best Practices

### Time Management
- Allow 15-30 minutes for thorough preflight
- Don't rush - this is critical safety time
- Perform in good lighting when possible
- Use written checklist

### Checklist Discipline
- Use the POH checklist as primary reference
- Don't rely on memory alone
- Challenge-Do-Verify method
- Read checklist items out loud

### Professional Habits
- Same routine every time
- Methodical, systematic approach
- Never skip items
- Document any discrepancies
- When in doubt, don't fly

## Training Exercise

### Supervised Preflight
**Objective**: Demonstrate complete preflight procedure

**Evaluation Criteria**:
1. Systematic approach
2. Proper use of checklist
3. Identification of discrepancies
4. Proper fuel sampling technique
5. Documentation review
6. Passenger briefing
7. Professional habits

## Common Student Errors
- ❌ Rushing through preflight
- ❌ Not using POH checklist
- ❌ Inadequate fuel sampling
- ❌ Missing documentation review
- ❌ Poor passenger briefing
- ❌ Not verifying control freedom
- ❌ Incomplete weight and balance

## Summary
A thorough preflight inspection is not just a regulatory requirement—it's a crucial safety practice that has prevented countless accidents. Every flight begins with a careful, systematic preflight procedure.

**Remember**: 
- "Preflight like your life depends on it—because it does."
- "Better to be safe on the ground than sorry in the air."
- "If you have any doubts, don't go."
