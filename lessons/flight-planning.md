# Flight Planning Fundamentals

## Overview
Proper flight planning is essential for safe and efficient flight operations. This lesson covers the fundamental elements of creating a comprehensive flight plan.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose and importance of flight planning
- Identify required elements of a flight plan
- Calculate time, distance, and fuel requirements
- Consider weather and alternate airports
- File and manage flight plans

## Why Flight Planning Matters
Flight planning is not just a regulatory requirement—it's a critical safety practice that helps pilots:
- Ensure adequate fuel reserves
- Identify suitable alternate airports
- Anticipate weather challenges
- Calculate weight and balance
- Estimate arrival times
- Communicate intentions to ATC and search and rescue services

## Essential Flight Planning Elements

### 1. Route Selection
**Considerations**:
- Direct vs. airways routing
- Terrain and obstacle clearance
- Weather patterns along route
- Airspace restrictions
- Radio navigation coverage
- Fuel availability at destination and alternates

### 2. Weather Analysis
**Required Weather Information**:
- Current conditions (METARs)
- Terminal forecasts (TAFs)
- En route weather
- Winds aloft
- AIRMETs, SIGMETs, and NOTAMs
- Freezing levels and icing potential

### 3. Performance Calculations

#### Fuel Planning
```
Total Fuel Required = Trip Fuel + Reserve Fuel + Alternate Fuel + Taxi Fuel

Minimum Reserves:
- VFR Day: 30 minutes
- VFR Night: 45 minutes
- IFR: 45 minutes + alternate
```

#### Time and Distance
```
Time = Distance ÷ Groundspeed
Groundspeed = True Airspeed ± Wind Component
```

### 4. Weight and Balance
- Calculate aircraft weight with fuel and payload
- Ensure weight is within limits
- Verify center of gravity is within envelope
- Consider fuel burn effects during flight

## Navigation Log Format

| Checkpoint | Course | Distance | TAS | Wind | GS | Time | Fuel |
|------------|--------|----------|-----|------|----|----- |------|
| Departure  | 360°   | -        | -   | -    | -  | -    | -    |
| Waypoint 1 | 360°   | 25nm     | 110 | +10  | 120| 12:30| 2.5  |
| Destination| -      | -        | -   | -    | -  | -    | -    |

## Filing Flight Plans

### VFR Flight Plan
Required information:
1. Aircraft identification
2. Aircraft type and equipment
3. True airspeed
4. Departure point and time
5. Proposed altitude
6. Route of flight
7. Destination
8. Estimated time en route
9. Fuel on board (hours and minutes)
10. Alternate airport
11. Number of people on board
12. Color of aircraft
13. Pilot information

### When to File
- **VFR**: Recommended for cross-country flights
- **IFR**: Required for all IFR operations
- File at least 30 minutes before departure

## In-Flight Planning

### Continuous Replanning
Flight planning doesn't stop at takeoff:
- Monitor actual groundspeed vs. planned
- Recalculate fuel burn and arrival time
- Assess weather developments
- Be prepared to divert to alternate

### Diversion Planning
If weather or mechanical issues arise:
1. Identify nearest suitable airport
2. Calculate new heading and distance
3. Estimate time and fuel to alternate
4. Communicate intentions to ATC
5. Update passengers

## Common Flight Planning Errors
- ❌ Inadequate fuel reserves
- ❌ Not checking NOTAMs
- ❌ Ignoring winds aloft forecasts
- ❌ Failing to select suitable alternates
- ❌ Not updating plan for changing conditions
- ❌ Poor chart preparation and organization

## Flight Planning Checklist
- [ ] Weather briefing obtained
- [ ] Route planned and charted
- [ ] Performance calculations completed
- [ ] Weight and balance verified
- [ ] Fuel requirements calculated
- [ ] Alternate airports identified
- [ ] NOTAMs reviewed
- [ ] Flight plan filed (if required)
- [ ] Passengers briefed
- [ ] Emergency equipment checked

## Practical Exercise

### Cross-Country Planning Scenario
**Mission**: Plan a VFR cross-country flight
- **From**: KBOS (Boston Logan)
- **To**: KALB (Albany International)
- **Aircraft**: Cessna 172SP
- **Passengers**: 2
- **Fuel**: 50 gallons usable
- **Cruise TAS**: 105 knots

**Tasks**:
1. Plot course on sectional chart
2. Measure distance and true course
3. Obtain weather briefing
4. Calculate wind correction and groundspeed
5. Determine fuel requirements
6. Select an alternate airport
7. Complete navigation log
8. File flight plan
