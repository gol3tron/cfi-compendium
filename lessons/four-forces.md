# Four Forces of Flight

## Overview
Every aircraft in flight is affected by four fundamental forces: **Lift**, **Weight**, **Thrust**, and **Drag**. Understanding how these forces interact is crucial for flight control and performance.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify and explain the four forces of flight
- Understand the relationship between forces in different flight conditions
- Apply knowledge of forces to practical flight scenarios
- Recognize how pilot inputs affect force balance

## The Four Forces

### 1. Lift
**Definition**: The force that opposes weight and is produced by the wing's interaction with the air.

**Key Points**:
- Generated primarily by the wings
- Acts perpendicular to the relative wind
- Increases with airspeed and angle of attack
- Equation: Lift = CL × ½ρV² × S

### 2. Weight
**Definition**: The force of gravity pulling the aircraft toward Earth's center.

**Key Points**:
- Acts toward the center of the Earth
- Constant for a given fuel and payload configuration
- Includes aircraft + fuel + passengers + cargo
- Can be reduced during flight as fuel is burned

### 3. Thrust
**Definition**: The forward force produced by the engine/propeller that opposes drag.

**Key Points**:
- Produced by the powerplant
- Can be controlled by the pilot (throttle)
- Must overcome drag to accelerate
- Required thrust varies with flight condition

### 4. Drag
**Definition**: The force that resists motion through the air.

**Key Points**:
- Acts parallel to the relative wind
- Two types: Parasite Drag and Induced Drag
- Increases with airspeed (parasite drag)
- Decreases with airspeed (induced drag)

## Force Relationships

### Straight and Level Flight
```
Lift = Weight
Thrust = Drag
```
The aircraft maintains constant altitude and airspeed.

### Climbing Flight
```
Lift < Weight (slightly)
Thrust > Drag
```
Excess thrust provides the energy needed to gain altitude.

### Descending Flight
```
Lift < Weight
Thrust < Drag
```
The aircraft trades altitude for airspeed or maintains airspeed while descending.

### Turning Flight
In a turn, lift must be increased to maintain altitude because it must:
1. Support the aircraft's weight
2. Provide the centripetal force for the turn

## Practical Exercises

### Ground Exercise
Using a model aircraft, demonstrate:
1. How each force is generated
2. The direction each force acts
3. What happens when forces become unbalanced

### Flight Exercise
1. Establish straight and level flight
2. Note power setting and attitude required
3. Perform a climb - observe power and pitch changes
4. Perform a descent - observe power and pitch changes
5. Execute a level turn - feel the increased back pressure needed

## Key Takeaways
- All four forces must be considered in every flight maneuver
- Changing one force requires adjusting others to maintain desired flight path
- Understanding force balance is essential for smooth, coordinated flight
- The pilot controls forces through:
  - **Pitch**: Affects lift and drag
  - **Power**: Affects thrust
  - **Bank**: Affects lift vector direction

## Study Questions
1. What happens to the four forces during a constant airspeed climb?
2. Why must lift exceed weight to start a climb?
3. How does drag change with airspeed?
4. What is the relationship between lift and bank angle in a turn?
