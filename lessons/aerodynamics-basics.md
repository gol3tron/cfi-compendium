# Aerodynamics Basics

## Overview
This lesson introduces the fundamental principles of aerodynamics as they apply to aircraft flight. Understanding these principles is essential for safe and effective flight operations.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define aerodynamics and its importance in aviation
- Explain the properties of air that affect flight
- Understand Bernoulli's Principle and its application to flight
- Describe the relationship between velocity and pressure

## Key Concepts

### What is Aerodynamics?
Aerodynamics is the study of how air flows around objects. In aviation, we focus on how air flows around aircraft and how this interaction produces the forces necessary for flight.

### Properties of Air
Air has several important properties that affect flight:
- **Density**: The mass of air molecules in a given volume
- **Pressure**: The force exerted by air molecules
- **Temperature**: Affects air density and performance
- **Humidity**: Water vapor content in the air

### Bernoulli's Principle
> "As the velocity of a fluid increases, the pressure exerted by that fluid decreases."

This fundamental principle explains how wings generate lift. As air flows over the curved upper surface of a wing, it speeds up and creates lower pressure above the wing compared to below.

## Practical Application

### In-Flight Demonstration
1. Observe how the aircraft responds to control inputs
2. Note the relationship between airspeed and control effectiveness
3. Discuss how altitude affects aircraft performance

### Discussion Questions
- How does temperature affect aircraft performance?
- Why is air density important for takeoff calculations?
- What happens to lift when airspeed decreases?

## Additional Resources
- FAA Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (Chapter 3)
- Advisory Circular AC 61-21A
- NASA Glenn Research Center - Aerodynamics Index

## Common Student Errors
- Confusing pressure and velocity relationships
- Not accounting for density altitude effects
- Overlooking the importance of air properties in flight planning

## Summary
Understanding aerodynamics basics provides the foundation for all subsequent flight training. These principles explain why and how aircraft fly, and form the basis for advanced topics in aircraft performance and safety.
